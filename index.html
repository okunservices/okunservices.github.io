		<h2>Gutter Cleaning</h2>
		<p>All of the debris within the gutters will be removed, and the downspouts will be cleared and ready for rain. This is done by either handpicking out the debris, or using a blower to remove the debri depending what will provide the best and tidiest end result. The natural debris is either returned to the earth (a wooded area) or hauled away depending on the situation. Okun Services does not offer repairs.</p>

		<h2>Window Cleaning</h2>
		<p>Inside and out. From traditional methods with a squeegee and a soap solution to embracing newer technology with the Water Fed Pole, you will surely love your crystal clear view. Everyone knows what a squeegee is, but it is safe to say you may not be familiar with the water fed pole. If that’s the case, read on...</p>
		
		<p>You will notice in the photo below a 3-stage water filtration system. This filters out all the minerals in your tap water. The water exits the machine, runs through a tube up the telescoping pole which has a soft bristle brush at the end which gently scrubs the glass. Since there are no minerals in the filtered water, your windows will dry completely
		spotless.</p>
		
		<p>If it is the first time in a long time having your windows cleaned then the best option would be the traditional style since there may be some tough scrubbing and more of a need for the face to glass approach.</p>
